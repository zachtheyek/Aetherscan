# TODO:

- describe project structure
- (tmp) we encourage contributions from the OSS community, but due to having limited maintainers, all PRs must be tied to an existing issue. if no issue exists yet, open one up & discuss ur changes before submitting a PR. all PRs that don’t follow these rules will be rejected automatically without human review
- are module level READMEs still needed? or unify everything here?
